# anisoVTA_dbs

## Purpose
This code aims at obtaining a better representation of Volume of Tissue Activated (VTA) modelling in Deep Brain Stimulation 
(DBS) for Parkinson Disease (PD) patients.

## Organization of files
At the moment the scripts are in a developing and testing phase. In particular battlefield.m is used to test any short code 
(one per section) and some of the sections are not finished because they are work-in-progress or because that direction has 
been abandoned for the time being.
All the successful parts are to be used to modify the ea_genvat_horn function in Lead-DBS toolbox, that is used as starting 
point to improve.
headmodel_fem indeed is to be converted in function and then implemented in ea_genvat_horn.
